# Road-Safety
This is a repository containing the projects which come under Road Safety.

We are building softwares to encompass the safety on roads, and under this light we have made the following projects:

  1.) Driver's Drowsiness and Distraction detector:
      
      In this we are making a device which will detect the drowsiness and distraction of the driver and start the warning.
      The detection will be OpenCV based.
 
 2) Smart Accident detector and informing it via mail/message to nearest hospital:
       
       we aim to use the smart cameras located on the highways of smart cities to detect the accident using opencv and machine learning          and inform to nearest hospital and police station about it.
