# Road-Safety
This is a repository containing the projects which come under Road Safety.

We are building softwares to encompass the safety on roads, and under this light we have made the following projects:

###  1.) Driver's Drowsiness and Distraction detector:
      
      In this we are making a device which will detect the drowsiness and distraction of the driver and start the warning.
      The detection will be OpenCV based.
 
###  2.) Smart Accident detector and informing it via mail/message to nearest hospital:
       
      This project is made for detecting accident on highways and informing to nearest hospital and police station in order   to save           the large number of lives lost everyday all over the world due to road accidents.
      This model is trained on 1000+ images which are not uploaded and can be easily found on internet for training,  
      cross-validating and testing the model.
      The testing of the model can be done by an accident video.
      We aim to use the smart cameras located on the highways of smart cities to detect the accident using opencv and machine learning           and inform to nearest hospital and police station about it.
