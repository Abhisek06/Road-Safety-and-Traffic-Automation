This model is still under progress.
We are creating a model which will detect the accident with the help of OpenCV and Machine Learning, and then based on the detection, inform the nearest hospital / Police Station through mail, along with the location of the accident and a snapshot of the moment of the accident. We aim to deploy the cameras located on the highways of smart cities for this purpose. We consider a birdâ€™s eye-view of the road but it will work well with other views also.
We have also decided to deal with the issue related to the delay in the treatment of the injured due to lack of FIR and no family information by implementing the following model: We will make a website and that website will contain all the neccesary information of the user. The website will give a unique key on its first usage and then that key will ve used in an andriod app to display all his information. The key will be visible even on the lock screen of the person's mobile phone and hence the hospitals would be able to enter the key into the webiste to get the entire details of that injured person.
